        <h2 id="#intro">Introduction</h2>
        <div class="title">
          The WeRateDogs data analysis project was an insightful yet challenging
          endeavor, particularly in the phases of assessing and cleaning the
          data. The primary hurdles were the variability in data quality and the
          diverse formats in which the information was presented.
        </div>
        <h2 id="challenges">Challenges</h2>
        <div class="title">
          The most challenging phase in this project was the cleaning step #06,
          which involved consolidating the doggo, floofer, pupper, and puppo
          columns into a single column named characteristic. This task was
          particularly demanding due to the presence of numerous NaN values and
          the introduction of duplicates after employing the pd.melt() function.
          Ensuring the accuracy of the name column by filtering out non-real
          names embedded within text added another layer of complexity. The
          assessment process, both visual and programmatic, was crucial in
          identifying these issues and ensuring data quality. Developing robust
          scripts to automate repetitive cleaning tasks was essential. Despite
          being time-consuming, these scripts were vital for maintaining data
          integrity, allowing for efficient and consistent data processing.
          Ultimately, overcoming these challenges in the data cleaning phase was
          instrumental in ensuring the reliability of the dataset. The
          meticulous efforts in addressing NaN values, duplicates, and
          inaccurate names laid a solid foundation for meaningful analysis,
          leading to accurate insights and a deeper understanding of the
          WeRateDogs data.

        <div class="d">One of these challenges are to keep threads while dropping retweets. As there is no problem comes from threads. See the remarkable issue in <a href="./wrangle_report.html" target="_blank">wrangle_report</a></div>

        <h2 id="eda">EDA</h2>
        <div class="title">
          As for EDA it highlights many helpful things as Atticus as the
          top-rated dog, Highest favorite count dog characteristic is Puppo, and
          highest retweet count dog characteristic is Doggo. The trends in
          engagement suggest that unique and engaging content significantly
          influences social media metrics. Pupper is the most popular dog
          characteristic. The top five dog names indicate a preference for
          traditional and popular names. Further analysis could explore the
          correlation between specific attributes and engagement metrics.

          In conclusion, while the assessment and cleaning phases presented
          significant obstacles, overcoming them was crucial for the project's
          success. The efforts invested in these stages ensured the reliability
          and validity of the analysis, ultimately leading to actionable
          insights and a deeper understanding of the WeRateDogs data.
